sort_tax_histo_nodes.cpp

  sorts one or more tax histo output files; 
  writes a separate output file for each

  Each file is read to a vector in memory,
  then sorted.

merge_sorted_tax_histo_files.cpp

  input is a list of sorted tax histo files;
  there should be no repeated kmers (the code
  doesn't check for this, you must ensure this);
  merges the data into a single output file.

  This uses an out-of-core merge sort, so memory
  usage is small
