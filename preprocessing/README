fixGenomeIDs.cpp

  replaces sequential numbering in *.header files with kpath IDs

===============================================================================
Codes for parsing the NCBI taxonomy,
extracting sequences with gi numbers,
and building lookup tables.



===============================================================================
Data files output by source code:

(note: gi is a sequence number assigned by NCBI; 
       gid (genome id) is a number that we assign to a sequence)

viral_gi.dat         - one gi number per line
gid2fasta_header.dat - gid (not gi!) number, followed by header 
viral_gi2tid.dat     - gid and tid on each line
viral_tid2gi.dat     - tid and gid on each line
tax_nodes.dat        - tid, parent, rank, name, on each line

all_virus_with_gi.fa - the subset of all_virus that contain gi numbers
                       (which is all except a couple of hundred)
all_virus_with_gi.fa.int - as above, but with headers replaced by integers
                           (so memory doesn't explode when we run jellylist_bin)
all_virus_with_gi.fa.int.bin.loc - binary encoded output from jellylist_bin;
                                   includes counts, genome IDs, and locations
===============================================================================
Source code:

getGI.py

  reads a fasta file and ignores sequences that lack a gi number;
  writess: viral_gi.dat, viral_gi.dat, all_virus_with_gi.fa,
  gid2fasta_header.dat, gid2gi.dat

gid2tid.cpp

  reads gi_taxid_nucl.dmp and viral_gi.dat; writes 
  viral_gid2tid.dat and viral_tid2did.dat.

tax.py

  reads nodes.dmp, writes tax_nodes.dat
