This file documents my attempts to improve read_label's
execution time via a step-by-step developmental process.
Some of the steps are intended as much for code cleaning
and clarity as they are for improving performance.

After each step I (attempt) to verify the revision is
correct by comparing its output on a smallish set of
tax_histo and queries, against the output from the
read_label version:

================================================================
read_label_v1.cpp

  replaced: 
    list<uint32_t> taxid_lst
      -- with --
    set<uint32_t> taxid_lst

  rationale: elements were added to taxid_list depending on the result
             of tax2idx.find(tid) == tax2idx.end().
             Both tax2idx and its inverse, idx2tax, will be
             removed in the future (when moving from the current
             dense  vector<vector<uint32_t> > label_matrix
             structure to a sparse counter-part
             
================================================================
read_label_v2.cpp
 
  modified fill_in_labels to use "map<uint32_t,uint16_t> taxids" 
  as a sparse row, rather than working with label_matrix[pos].  
  At the end of fill_in_labels, however, we transfer the counts
  back to label_matrix[pos], so the remainder of the code works
  as before.
