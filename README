Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Tool Index Preparation Suite

This software package contains source files to build binaries needed
for reference database index preparation and execution of the search
tool read_label_lo.

The search tool runs in two modes: (1) build index + search (2) load index
and search.  We recommend mode 2 because full database indices take
long times to build, so pre-building an index and loading on
subsequent execution of the search tool avoids repetition of the index
building phase.  The index load phase uses memory-mapped files. 


Compilation:

Set up environment variables necessary for index file generation and loading 





in the src/ directory  

Note that the source repo used for development is different than the directory 
stuctrure that is used for the LMAT release tarballs.  This was done so we can 
export a cleaner version to the end user as our repo contains many additional
experimental tools that aren't suitable for release.

Two things to node:

1)  due to an an archaic build environment, you need to set evniroment variable
METAG_DIR=<this-repo-root-dir>

2) the perm-je library is disrtributed separately.  The LMAT-1.2X tarballs contain the 
latest compatible version.  Don't use perm-je from LMAT-1.1X or earlier.
