Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Tool Index Preparation Suite

This software package contains source files to build binaries needed
for reference database index preparation and execution of the search
tool read_label_lo.

The search tool runs in two modes: (1) build index + search (2) load index
and search.  We recommend mode 2 because full database indices take
long times to build, so pre-building an index and loading on
subsequent execution of the search tool avoids repetition of the index
building phase.  The index load phase uses memory-mapped files. 


Compilation:

Set up environment variables necessary for index file generation and loading 





in the src/ directory
