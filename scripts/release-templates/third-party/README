This directory contains third party codes that
are freely available and/or released under gnu
or similar open source licenses. Our release includes
prebuilt binaries that were compiled under linux redhat.
Our hope is that these will work for you out-of-the-box.

Should you need to (re)build the libraries/executables for
your system, try running 'make all.'
